# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_FINANCIAL_DATA_ANALYSIS

I completed this Power BI project in collaboration with UNP United Network of Professionals, where I analyzed a retail company’s financial dataset.
In this project, I evaluated the overall business performance using structured data analysis techniques.
First, I cleaned the data by removing unnecessary columns and correcting inconsistencies to ensure accuracy.
After preparing the dataset, I created calculated columns and important financial measures for analysis.
I developed key metrics such as Total Sales, Total Profit, Total COGS, Units Sold, and Discounts to measure performance.
I titled my dashboard “Prime Retail Corporation” and designed it using a top-down analytical approach.
I created pages like Financial Overview, Sales Performance Analysis, and Profitability Analysis for detailed insights.
I used visualizations such as line charts, bar charts, and maps to present the data clearly and effectively.
Overall, this dashboard helped me convert raw financial data into meaningful insights to support data-driven decisions.
